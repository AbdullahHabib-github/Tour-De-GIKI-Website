# Tour-De-GIKI-Website
A course project which required the students to design a website using HTML and CSS. We created a website named "Tour de GIKI", which can guide the visitors of the institute about the directions and details of some of the most important areas of the Institute. 
Basic concepts of HTML and CSS were used to develop this website.
-->The folder "Code for project" contains text files containing the code of each webpage.
-->The folder "CS 121 project" contains the web pages and all the images used in these web pages.
-->The word file, named "Documentation" contains a detailed project analysis.
Note that the web pages in the folder "CS 121 project" might not work because the addresses used that of the host PC, it might be different for different PCs.
